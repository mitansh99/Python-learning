# stets are used to store multipule values in single var

# sets = unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.

# Sets - do not allow duplicate values.

# We can't remove the items from the set but we can remove items

# true and 1 is equal in sets (SAME VALUE) FALSE == 0

len(thisset) # get the length of the set

type(thisset) # <class 'set'>

# It is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set.


thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
